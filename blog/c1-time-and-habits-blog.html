    <h1>My Thoughts on Time</h1>
    <p>
      After reading through the resources on the 'Time' page of the EDA curriculum repository, I have a fair idea of what techniques may and may not work for me;
    </p>
    <h3>Things that may work:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Pomodoro Technique - I have had no real chance to actually try this out yet, but it seems like something that would suit my learning style.
      </li>
      <li>
        Growth Mindset - The idea of small task to achieve confidence to accomplish bigger tasks makes alot of sense to me, as I have noticed this without realising in alot of other aspects in life.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Things that may not work:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meditiation - I dont believe I have the right mindset to be able to do this, but who knows, that may change!
      </li>
      <li>
        Mindfulness - Similar to the above point, I dont think I have to abilty to be able to completely clear my mind.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p> In conclusion I am most interested in the Pomodoro Technique, so will be digger deeper into that first</p>
