    <h2>Thoughts After Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
<h3>I have decided this will be best in a Q and A format</h3>
    <div>
<ul>
<li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I believe that the course is now a learning group activity rather than a traditional lecture enviroment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your impressions?
</ul>
<p>
  Shareef is putting alot of emphasis on that fact that the students mindset when they enter the course is one of the most important things to get right. This needs to be correct in order to gained the most value from the course.
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I believe I will get along well in this enviroment, due to my prior industry being heavily team based.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
</ul>
<p>
No, as this is what I expected - I was given a decent briefing of EDA from a friend beforehand.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I am feeling both those emotions currently, but thankfully a little more excited than nervous!
